# CCSN-GW-detection-with-DL-methods
This project decomposes in two parts: 
  On the one hand an algorithm to create a set of images of the gravitational wave models of Core-Collapse Supernovae were theoretical models are injected to real background noise from O2. 
  In the other hand Deep Learning techniques are used to detect this gravitational radiation over background noise.
